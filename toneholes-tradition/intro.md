#What we can learn from a 40,000 year old flute

Sometime between 40,000 and 45,000 years ago, a group of early humans on a migration route out of Africa, along the corridor of the Danube River valley, carried with them a small but significant object: a flute. 

Carved from the bone of a griffon vulture, with five carefully crafted finger holes, this instrument lay buried and forgotten for tens of thousands of years — until recently, when it was discovered in the cavernous halls of the Hohle Fels Cave in the Swabian Jura mountain range of southwestern Germany. 

The oldest yet of a series of similar flutes discovered in the region, the _Hohle Fels flute_ tells us many things about the cultural innovations of early humans. In particular, one important thing is now clear: during their migration from Africa into Europe as early as 40,000 years ago, our ancestors were already making music along the way.

###Origins of the flute

Discoveries such as the Hohle Fels flute provide us with valuable insight into our collective past — important for piecing together the chronology of our common story, the tale of how we all came to be. This story should be significant to anyone who cares about our future here on earth (or on any other planet we may yet inhabit), because, as we now know through the unraveling of our genetic lineage, the human story has been one continuum: we are all descendants of the same people that, some 65,000 years ago, forged their place in history when they began their trek out of Africa and, over the course of thousands of generations, settled the world.

From the beginning, the human story has always been a social venture. We have never been alone in this world. Our ancestors walk beside us in every moment: their minds are our minds. Equally so, the future "us" walks beside us too, yet invisible but awaiting to spring forth from what we are now. It has never been truer when we say, "who we are is who we were" — and that will be equally true for people in the future. It's fascinating to think that we are ever in the process of becoming somebody's ancestors. We're writing that story, right now.

What's equally intriguing is exploring what the Hohle Fels flute can tell us about the minds of our ancestors, and their tendency to want to express themselves creatively and intellectually — both symbolically through art, and through the powerful act of communal music making. Along with other objects that have been uncovered from the same time period — exquisitely sculpted figurines, engraved drawings, and figurative cave paintings, to name a few — the existence of the flute in the prehistoric record is symbolic proof that the minds of the ancients were indeed capable of a high level of thought and expression, and sought to explore that capacity. These people were not intellectually idle. 

Why is all of this significant? Because it help us answer the question of _when_ the capacity for intellectual thought and creativity arose. This question is important because it has the opportunity to help us understand

overcome our own cultural conceit that we are somehow the pinnacle of human cultural progress.

its important to realize that the capacity for intellectual thought has always existed, but culture is a matter of choice: what do we choose to do with it.

The problem with answering this question is that we tend to use the yardstick of our own culture's achievements to measure all others. 

— but it's folly to think that it is merely our technological achievements that define intellectual capacity. 

Culture has always been about choice: what pursuit

But it also reveals something about the kinds of things that became important, early on, to the development of modern humans on a fundamental level — factoring into the growth of culture itself.

And whether that raw genius is placed in service of technological wizardry or unraveling the complex thread of memory inherent in a myth is simply a matter of choice and cultural orientation"

"Race has been exposed as a total fiction; the human genetic endowment is one continuum. We are all descendants of a handful of people who’ve walked out of Africa 65,000 years ago, and in 2,500 generations settled the whole world. But if we accept that we are all cut from the same genetic cloth, all cultures share the same genius. And whether that genius is placed into technological wizardry which has been our great achievement, or, by contrast, placed into the unraveling of complex threads of memory inherent in a myth is simply a matter of choice"

“These peoples, these cultures, are not failed attempts at being us — they are unique answers to the fundamental question, ‘What does it mean to be human and alive?’”

"celebrate the wonders of the human legacy"

and that played into the formation and growth of the subconscious mind.

Music — and in particular, the flute — have long been a part of the human psyche. We know now, from radiocarbon dating of artifacts like the flute found in the Hohle Fels cave, that the flute itself is likely the oldest type of musical instrument created by humans — and that humans were making music  with it much earlier in history than previously thought. 

Being such a venerable 

The sound of the flute is as fundamental and elegant as wind moving through reeds, but that its voice comes from the breath of the player, invoking it to resonate with sound, gives it a certain power. It's quite magical, when you think about it: the flautist conjuring into song the vital element of air. For the ancient flutemaker, though, to be endowed with the skill to manipulate the elements of bone, wood, and air into a device capable of such magic: to the ancients, this must have been significant.

It would be difficult, then, to understand human nature without attempting to understand the role that music played in the lives of our early ancestors.

Radiocarbon dating of artifacts like the flute found in the Hohle Fels cave provides us with significant new insight into our collective past — important for piecing together the chronology of our common story, the tale of how we came to be.

What intrigues me most, though, about the discovery of this instrument is what it tells us about the minds of our ancestors, and their ability to express themselves creatively — both symbolically through art, and through the powerful act of communal music making. Along with other objects that have been uncovered from the same time period — exquisitely sculpted figurines, engraved drawings, and figurative cave paintings, to name a few — the Hohle Fels flute illustrates that the minds of the ancients were indeed capable of a high level of thought and expression. But it also inspires questions about the kinds of things that were important to early modern humans on a fundamental level: at what point in our human history did art and music become an integral part of our lives? 

What need or yearning inspired its creation, and what thought process went into its construction? What technical knowledge did the ancient flutemaker possess, and through what methodology of observation and trial were those skills acquired?

As for the instrument's musical capabilities, specific measurements of the flute — its length, column diameter, and toneholes — can yield a good approximation of the tonal scale that it would produce, but we can only wonder about the actual music that was played on it. For what melodies was it intended? What was the effect on the listener as its songs reverberated through the ancient concert chambers of hillside caves?  While bone and rock can survive the ravages of time, a song leaves its footprint only on the minds of those who witness its performance. In many ways, this is the enigma of our past: science can only tell us so much about the moment in time represented by an artifact; the rest is left to our imagination.

Origins: bone survives, but what about tambin? Wood flutes. Wind blowing through vines? If they were creating flutes, one would think they had songs they also sung.

[do we need this stuff??]  
The cliche notion of prehistoric cave dwellers grunting while wielding clubs gets replaced with an image of a somewhat more sophisticated lot, capable of using creative means to understand, explore, celebrate, and grieve. This is not to say that everyone was an artist, but that the capability existed — and was, in fact, used to create art (and presumably music) with an aesthetic value that could be appreciated on its own terms even today.

Some people may ask, "So what?" What connection can we draw from this ancient heritage of cultural expression to the present time? I believe it is this: that our own psyche as human beings today has been shaped by the presence of art and music for millennia, inextricable from our existence and survival on earth, since time out of mind. It is a critical part of what always did — and still does — make us who we are. To neglect it is to deny a part of ourselves. 

Each one of us comes into the world with the inherent capability to create, and the inclination to inquire, explore, and experiment — and even fail — as part of the process of learning. So why do we see some people as being more creative than others? It's that some of us _continue to use_ that penchant for creativity more than others. Those seen as innovators were not born with more or less of a _capability_ to create, but simply _didn't stop_ using it, and were not afraid to fail in the process.

###Understanding the Flute

Despite being one of the world's oldest types of musical instrument, the flute is also one of the most difficult to comprehend, in terms of the physics that allow it to operate. Perhaps moreso than any other instrument, the flute embodies the physical properties of sound itself: the shape and design of the flute must accommodate the actual soundwaves moving through air to produce notes. We have all at some point experienced blowing across the top of a bottle, producing a volume of sound at a specific pitch, but how does this happen?

Perhaps the greatest challenge in woodwind design and construction is the accurate placement of each tonehole to produce the desired notes and scale. 
Building a _Fulani Flute_ (or _tambin_) — a beautiful and deceptively complex flute found in parts of West Africa — is no exception.

Traditional flutemakers in West Africa, however, accomplish this feat with surprising accuracy and consistency, without the aid of advanced measurement tools, tuners, or mathematics. Skilled artisans, they rely heavily on intuition, and often utilize nothing but their own fingers as "measuring sticks" — without paper and pen, the relationships of the instrument to their own arms and fingers are memorized, so that specific ratios can be reproduced again in future efforts. Having honed their skills with a lifetime of musical immersion, they fine-tune the pitch of their instruments by ear until the flute can sing back to them the very songs they grew up with.

The cumulative knowledge acquired by the traditional flutemaker through a lifetime of experimentation and training is impressive. Equally as fascinating, though, is how the simple, raw materials from which this ancient woodwind is built seem to belie the underlying complexity of the physics behind it. Fashioned from a woody vine found along the banks of the Niger River, the _tambin_ features just three holes, and an embouchure sculpted from black beeswax. Adornment with leather, rope, and cowrie shells completes the aesthetic of an object which, born of the earth, carries a significance beyond its primary function. No child's toy, in the skilled hands of the _fula-fola_ these enchanting flutes produce 2½ octaves via four distinct registers, and are capable of the finest subtleties of musical expression. That the living breath of the player awakens elements of wood and earth to resonate into sacred song gives the flutes a place in the realm of the mystical — both for those who play it, and for those who are transported by its sounds.

Over the [course of many trips to Guinea, West Africa][1], I had the opportunity to study with a master craftsman who was renowned throughout the region for his flute-making. As an apprentice, I learned to make (and play) my own Fulani flutes.

<!-- [say more about this experience and bridge into next section] ...-->

Here in the States, I refined my process to make a flute that was more durable — it needed to survive the extreme cold of New England winters — with materials and tools that were available to me locally. Necessity, as well as my own innate curiosity, drove me to veer from the methods and materials of traditional West African flute-building, and to find out what was possible. Since new materials required different methods of determining tonehole placement, I dug into the available literature on the science of woodwind instrument building.

For three years I absorbed every bit of information I could find on the subject. Combining this with my experiences in West Africa and a working knowledge of how these flutes were built, I produced dozens of prototypes in my workshop in northern New Hampshire. Numerous failed attempts preceded even the first remotely playable flute. A sad-looking pile of discarded flutes accumulated beneath my workbench — but every failed attempt revealed critical new information that spurred me onwards to try again, even if only to make new mistakes. In this manner, the _tambin_ slowly began to reveal its secrets — not all at once, and not even every time — but the flutes I was now producing had begun to take on a character that were somehow richer, and assuredly more enjoyable to play. With patience, I found that subtle changes made big differences. I strove to perfect the shape, size, and angles of the embouchure. Toneholes grew larger and then smaller again on subsequent flutes, as I experimented with finding just the right ratios.

Unbeknownst to me, through repeated trial and error, experimentation and failure, I had been moving through a passage of initiation similar to that which brings forth a traditional flute-maker in West Africa. I was no longer _copying_ a model of a flute, as I once had as an apprentice in our hot, dusty workshop in Conakry...but learning to _create_ one. In the process, I discovered something else quite unexpected: _how to learn_. It was the most important secret that the flute had revealed to me.

What follows is a series of tools and charts I've developed over the course of my flute-making journey, to aid in the calculation of tonehole placement for a 3-hole Fulani Flute made from uniform diameter tube. While this "electronic worksheet" is the result of honing my process with many dozens of flutes, the ideas (and mathematic equations) are based largely on the formulas and principles outlined in [Bart Hopkin's _Air Columns and Toneholes: Principles for Wind Instrument Design_][2] — a fabulous resource for aspiring flutemakers and enthusiasts alike. That resource has proven to be invaluable to me numerous times as I searched for answers as to why a particular flute was slightly off, or while continuously striving to improve upon a prior prototype. I share this tool in the hopes that it may be of some benefit (or at least some interest) to someone else out there embarking on a similar path...

###Variables

In order to properly calculate the placement of toneholes on a flute, several variables come into play. They are:
