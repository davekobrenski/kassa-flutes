Sometime between 40,000 and 45,000 years ago, a group of early humans on a migration route out of Africa, along the corridor of the Danube River valley, carried with them a small but significant object: a flute. 

Carved from the bone of a griffon vulture, with five carefully crafted finger holes, this instrument lay buried and forgotten for tens of thousands of years — until recently, when it was discovered in the cavernous halls of the Hohle Fels Cave in the Swabian Jura mountain range of southwestern Germany. 

The oldest yet of a series of similar flutes found in the region — which represent the oldest known musical instruments in the world — the _Hohle Fels flute_ sheds light on the lives and cultural innovations of early humans. One thing, in particular, is worth emphasizing: during their migration from Africa into Europe as early as 40,000 years ago, our ancestors were already making music.

Music, then — and in particular, the flute — have long been a part of the human psyche. From radiocarbon dating of artifacts like the flute found in the Hohle Fels cave, we know that the flute itself is likely the oldest _type_ of musical instrument created by humans — and that humans were making music with it much earlier in history than previously thought.

Perhaps being a flutist and flutemaker myself makes me biased, but this is fascinating stuff — and for more reasons than just happening to appreciate flutes. The essence of the flute is as fundamental as wind moving through reeds, but its unique power comes from the fact that what _gives it voice_ is the living breath of the player, invoking it to resonate with sound. It's quite magical, when you think about it: the flutist conjuring into song the vital element of air. For the ancient flutemaker, though, to be endowed with the skill to manipulate elements of bone, wood, and air into a device capable of such magic: to the ancients, we can surmise, this must have been significant.

Contrary to its elemental nature, the flute is anything _but_ elementary in terms of the physical laws that allow it to operate. Perhaps moreso than any other instrument, the flute embodies the physical properties of sound itself: the shape and design of the flute must accommodate the actual soundwaves moving through air in order to produce notes. Furthermore, a wide array of factors come into play that alter the sound that comes out of a flute — and that determine even _if_ a sound comes out. The diameter and length of the tube, the size and shape of the mouthpiece, and even the size of the toneholes in relation to their placement along the tube are just a few important factors to consider when building even the most basic of flutes. In short, constructing a playable flute is no simple business.

As for the 40,000 year-old Hohle Fels Flute, what would it have sounded like? Specific measurements of its length, tube diameter, and placement of its toneholes can yield for us the tonal scale that it would have produced when played. In fact, an actual reconstructed replica, reverse-engineered from exact measurements of the fragile original, revealed the Hohle Fels Flute to be quite comparable to a modern-day flute. When played, it produced, across multiple octaves, a complete pentatonic scale — one of the world's most common scales, forming the basis of much of modern music.

We can deduce that the flute found in the Hohle Fels cave was not a one-off. Careful inspection of the artifact shows that small lines were first etched into the flute, indicating where to "drill" the holes — so at the outset, some measurement and calculated thought of where the holes should go took place. Based on my own experience making flutes, the flutemaker's knowledge of where to place the holes to produce accurate pitch must have been the result of significant trial and error, through the development of many prototypes — perhaps even from knowledge passed down through generations. We might take this even further by suggesting that, since bone would not have been the easiest material to work with, even earlier flutes may have existed that were made from various types of wood — these items would not have survived to become part of the fossil record. How much further back in time, then, did this legacy of flute-making go? I suppose we will never know.

But just to muse on it is enough. If we travel back in time in our mind's eye, we can marvel at the sparks of ingenuity and creativity that led to the world's first musical instruments. We can wonder about the actual music that was played on those first flutes: for what melodies were they intended? What was the effect on the listeners as their songs reverberated through the ancient concert chambers of hillside caves? 

While bone and rock can survive the ravages of time, a song leaves its footprint only on the minds of those who witness its performance. In many ways, this is the enigma of our past: science can only tell us so much about the moment in time represented by an artifact; the rest is left to our imagination.

My interest in the flutes of indigenous peoples around the world began during [my travels in West Africa][1], where I had the opportunity to study the _tambin_, the unique three-holed flute of the Fulani and Malinké people of Guinea. 

Constructed from a woody vine that is the flute's namesake, the _tambin_, or _Fula Flute_, likely originated with the Fulani people — one of the most widely dispersed ethnic groups in Africa, and the largest pastoral nomadic group in the world. The Fulani today live throughout West and Central Africa, with much of their population concentrated in the Fouta Djallon highlands of Guinea. Fulani culture dates back to at least the Neolithic era, with the most notable evidence of this being the resplendent treasury of rock art discovered in the Tassili n'Ajjer mountain range in Algeria — containing over 15,000 unique engravings and dating back to 6000 BC.

Across a half-dozen or so trips to Guinea, I was able to learn from several _fulafolas_ — masters of the _Fula flute_. In addition to studying much of the tambin's repertoire, I learned the traditional building techniques of this ancient flute from a Malinké man hailing from the Kouroussa region of Guinea, in a small village tucked away on a bend of the Niger River. His name was Lancine Conde. Under his tutelage, I became his "little brother", and with more patience than I often deserved, he imparted his knowledge to me.

There, along the mighty Niger, where it winds through low-lying countryside, the tambin vine grows in abundance. The vine itself is wood-like and hollow throughout, with sturdy outer walls, not unlike bamboo or rattan. As I found out, it is well-suited to flute building: its plentiful availability lends itself to experimentation, and its natural taper overcomes the problem of upper-register flatness that is inherent in cylindrical flutes. Both the embouchure and toneholes can be easily burned into the vine, without need for complicated tools. Being a transverse (side-blown) flute, the tambin incorporates a winged-style embouchure, which assists greatly in producing the flute's full range of 2½ octaves; these raised wings are constructed out of a locally available type of black beeswax (referred to elsewhere in the world as bee _cerumin_). The cerumin can be heated and easily molded to suit the player's needs. Due to its high propolis content, when the cerumin dries, it hardens to a solid mass and adheres to the vine.

One of the biggest challenges in woodwind design and construction is the accurate placement of each tonehole to produce the desired notes and scale. The tambin is no exception. Traditional flutemakers in West Africa such as Lancine, however, accomplish this feat with surprising accuracy and consistency, without the aid of advanced measurement tools, tuners, or mathematics. Skilled artisans, they rely heavily on intuition, and often utilize nothing but their own fingers as "measuring sticks" — without paper and pen, the relationships of the instrument to their own arms and fingers are memorized, so that specific ratios can be reproduced again in future efforts. Having honed their skills with a lifetime of musical immersion, they fine-tune the pitch of their instruments by ear until the flute can sing back to them the very songs they grew up with.

The cumulative knowledge acquired by the traditional flutemaker through a lifetime of experimentation and training is impressive. Equally as fascinating, though, is how the simple, raw materials from which this ancient woodwind is built seem to belie the underlying complexity of the physics behind it. Adornment with leather, rope, and cowrie shells completes the aesthetic of an object which, born of the earth, carries a significance beyond its primary function. No child's toy, in the skilled hands of the _fulafola_ these enchanting flutes are capable of the finest subtleties of musical expression. That the living breath of the player awakens elements of wood and earth to resonate into sacred song gives the flutes a place in the realm of the mystical — both for those who play it, and for those who are transported by its sounds.

Back home in the States, I wanted to see just how feasible it would be to produce my own tambin-style flute. How complicated could it be? These were, after all, essentially the same type of flute that humans had been making out of bone, wood, and ivory for literally tens of thousands of years, if not more. Without Lancine there to coach me, I quickly realized that I was in for a humbling experience.

An avid tinkerer, I decided to "refine" the process to make a flute that was more durable — it needed to survive the extreme cold of New England winters — with materials and tools that were, of course, available to me locally. Necessity, as well as my own innate curiosity, drove me to veer from the methods and materials of traditional West African flute-building, and to find out what was possible. New materials — having different tube diameters, wall thickness, and more — required different methods of determining tonehole placement...so I dug into the available literature on the science of woodwind instrument building.

For three years I absorbed every bit of information I could find on the subject. Combining this with my experiences with Lancine in West Africa and a working knowledge of how these flutes were built, I produced dozens of prototypes in my workshop in northern New Hampshire. Numerous failed attempts preceded even the first remotely playable flute. A sad-looking pile of discarded flutes accumulated beneath my workbench — but every failed attempt revealed critical new information that spurred me onwards to try again, even if only to make new mistakes. In this manner, the tambin slowly began to reveal its secrets — not all at once, and not even every time — but the flutes I was now producing had begun to take on a character that were somehow richer, and assuredly more enjoyable to play. With patience, I found that subtle changes made big differences. I strove to perfect the shape, size, and angles of the embouchure. Toneholes grew larger and then smaller again on subsequent flutes, as I experimented with finding just the right ratios.

Unbeknownst to me, through repeated trial and error, experimentation and failure, I had been moving through a passage of initiation similar to that which brings forth a traditional flute-maker in West Africa. I was no longer _copying_ a model of a flute, as I once had as an apprentice in our hot, dusty workshop in West Africa…but learning to _create_ one. In the process, I discovered something else quite unexpected: _how to learn_. It was the most important secret that the flute had revealed to me.

All in all, it took over three years of concerted effort — with reliance on mathematical equations, calipers, and electronic tuners — to finally produce a flute that I thought could rival the quality and playability of the flutes made by Lancine — who still uses only the most basic tools to create instruments of unprecedented quality.

Discoveries such as the Hohle Fels flute in southwestern Germany provide us with valuable insight into our collective past — important for piecing together the chronology of our common story, the tale of how we all came to be. Additionally, the survival into modern times of traditions like those exemplified by the ancient Fulani flute reveal to us that our collective story is indeed a continuum. Through the unraveling of our genetic lineage, we now know with certainty that we are all descendants of the same people that, some 65,000 years ago, ignited a historical spark when they began their trek out of Africa and, over the course of thousands of generations, settled the world. That continuum does not end with us.

From the beginning, the human story has always been a social venture. We have never been alone in this world. Our ancestors walk beside us in every moment: their minds are our minds. Equally so, the future "us" walks beside us too, awaiting to spring forth from who and what we are today. It has never been truer when we say, "who we *are* is who we *were*" — and that will be equally true for the people of the future. It's fascinating to think that we are in the process of becoming somebody's ancestors. We're writing that story, right now.

What's equally intriguing, then, is exploring what these stories can tell us about the minds of our ancestors, and their tendency to want to express themselves creatively and intellectually — both symbolically through art, and through the powerful act of communal music making. The existence of the flute, for example, in the prehistoric record is symbolic proof that the minds of the ancients were indeed capable of a high level of thought and expression, and sought to explore that capacity. These people were not intellectually idle. 

Why does all of this matter? Because it helps us answer the question of _when_ the capacity for intellectual thought and creativity arose, and thus helps us with the problem of overcoming the cultural conceit that exists in the modern world that somehow we represent the pinnacle of human achievement. The problem with answering this question, of course, is that we tend to use the yardstick of our own culture's achievements to measure all others — using a comparison, for instance, of our own technological progress as the gauge of whether another society has succeeded in becoming fully human. This is folly. If we can accept that all people share the same genetic lineage, then we must also accept that we share the same capacity for intellectual thought, creativity, and innovation. How a people expresses that potential is simply a matter of choice. What results from those choices _is_ culture.

The artifacts discovered in the Hohle Fels Cave, dating back some 40,000 years, are proof that this capacity existed even then, and quite possibly long before. The myriad of cultures that have existed since then have found infinitely diverse ways to express that capacity through their own unique brilliance, in their own place and time — but we in the West have too often been blinded by our own progress to see it. As a result of that ignorance, we have inflicted no end of suffering upon indigenous peoples throughout the world.

In the process of unearthing the ancient flutes of Hohle Fels, we have the opportunity to uncover yet another extraordinary truth: that despite our incredible diversity of thought and expression, we humans are more similar than we are different. The field of genetics has shown us that the DNA of all human beings alive today is 99.9% alike — and the discoveries made along the migration corridor of the Danube River shows that the creative capacity for artistic and musical expression has always been a part of what it means to be human. These venerable trademarks of human culture are a legacy that should always be celebrated and supported, however and wherever they are found.
