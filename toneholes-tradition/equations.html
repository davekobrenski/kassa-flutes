<h3>Equations</h3>
<p>Using these variables, the equation used for calculating the amount of tonehole correction (\( C \)) and thus the placement of each tonehole is:</p>

<div class="well math">$$ C\ =\ s/2\ [\sqrt{1\ +\ 4(t_e\ /\ s)\ (d_t\ /\ d_h)^2}\ -\ 1] $$</div>

<p>Once we have determined the tonehole correction (\( C \)), the location of each individual tonehole (\( L_h \)) can then be calculated using:</p>

<div class="well math">$$ L_h\ =\ L_{eff}\ -\ C $$</div>

<h3>Tube Lengths</h3>

<p>To start building our flute, we need to know how long, initially, to make the tube that will become our flute â€” in other words, we need to know the <em>effective</em> tube length (\( L_{eff} \)) for our <em>lowest note</em> (the note that will play with all holes closed). To find that initial length, we need the frequency of the lowest note, and the speed of sound at the temperature in which we are working. With those two, we can find the wavelength (\( \lambda \)) of the note by dividing the speed of sound (\( c \)) by the frequency (\( f \)):</p>

<div class="well math">$$ \lambda\ =\ c\ /\ f $$</div>

<p>For example, if the lowest note were middle C (261.63 <small>Hz</small>), we would take the speed of sound (<?=$speedOfSound?> cm/second) and divide by the frequency, 261.63, to get its wavelength:</p>

<div class="well math">$$ <?=$speedOfSound?>\ /\ 261.63\ =\ 132.25\ cm $$</div>

<p>Finally, to arrive at our <em>effective</em> tube length> \( L_{eff} \) we simply divide in half (for a flute that is open at both ends):</p>

<div class="well math">$$ (<?=$speedOfSound?>\ /\ 261.63)\ \times\ .5\ =\ 66.125\ cm $$</div>

<p>So, for a theoretical flute that was intended to have middle C as its lowest note, we would start by making the flute about 66 cm, and then slowly trim it down from there until the flute produced the desired note&hellip;thus arriving at our <em>actual length</em> (our variable \( A \)).</p>

<h3>Chart #1</h3>

<p>Below is a chart that shows the calculated values of wavelength and \( L_{eff} \) for all of the common notes found on a Fulani flute. You can refer to this chart to determine the <em>approximate initial length</em> of the flute for the desired lowest note:</p>
