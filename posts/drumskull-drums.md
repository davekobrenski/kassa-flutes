We are very pleased to announce that a selection of high-quality Fula flutes made by the Kassa Flute Co. are now available at [DrumSkull Drums][drumskull].

Here at the Kassa Flute Co., we are committed to high standards of quality and craftsmanship. These standards, combined with our passion for the music of West Africa, drive us to constantly push ourselves to make the very best Fula flutes -- flutes that are both beautiful to look at and a joy to play. In doing so, we strive to honor our teachers in West Africa as well as the [ancient tradition of flutemaking][article].

It gives us great pride, then, to announce a partnership with another shop that shares those commitments to quality and cultural respect: [DrumSkull Drums][drumskull], located in Santa Cruz, California. 

DrumSkull Drums will be carrying a selection of Fula flutes made by the Kassa Flute Co. You can check out their current selection online here: [www.drumskulldrums.com][drumskull], or if you're in the Santa Cruz area, [drop by their shop][location].

**From the DrumSkull website:**

"DrumSkull Drums is the world's leading percussion shop rooted in the music of West Africa. For almost two decades we have offered professional instruments of uncompromised quality. We remain true to our goals and we continue to expand on our focus of quality and community. Our inspiration is a culmination of over thirty years of West African & Congolese drum and dance education felt strong in the bay area of California. As students of this music, we feel extremely fortunate to have the respect and support of so many influential teachers throughout the US and in Africa.

"Drumskull Drums is not simply a business. It is a way of life, the ultimate search to be a Drumskull! As life long students of the djembe, we are dedicated toward studying the technique, history, and craft of these instruments. Throughout this endeavor, we have invested countless hours in drum and dance classes, rehearsals, and performances. We are fortunate to have taken repeated trips to the countries of Guinea, Mali, Senegal, Cote dÂ´Ivoire and Ghana. It is our goal to encourage the spread of West African and Congolese music, support the African teachers that have brought it to us and ultimately create the finest instruments possible. 

"For years, Drumskulls have sought to set a new standard in the market of African instruments. Although music consciousness is on the rise, in truth, it is quite disheartening to see the hoards of low quality tourist imports that still get sold as authentic instruments. As you go further into this web site, we hope our difference in quality is obvious to you. Our meticulous efforts are well represented by our custom designed rope, our individually fitted rings, and our hand picked wood, shells, and skins. We believe our drums to be the finest anywhere! We hope that you will be inspired by this site, and that you too will join us in our endeavor to support and spread the music of Africa."
