Lanciné Conde

BIOGRAPHY

Born on June 12, 1970 in Kouroussa, Guinea, Lanciné Conde began playing the flute at 7 years old. As a shepherd in the Sanankoro district, in the prefecture of Kouroussa, Lancine had no master with whom he could study the flute. At night in the village, however, Lancine would listen to the sounds on the radio (which was rare in the villages during these years), and in the morning when he would return to his flock in the "bush", he would repeat what he had heard on his traditional flute. The flute that he played -- called _sangbarra_ in the Malinké language -- was the traditional flute of the shepherds in this region, and was often made of wood. Lancine constructed for himself a flute fashioned after the traditional shepherd's instrument, but made from iron. It was in this way, as a shepherd living in a remote village in rural Guinea near the Niger River, that he learned to play the flute.

At age 15, he went to a nearby village called Sangbarala or he met the circumcising of this place called Mossogbè-Ansoumane, it was offered for the first time two (2) tubes long flutes called in Malinke language (tambi) Lanciné has manufactured himself these tubes flute finished product.

His father (El-Hajj Sekou Conde) was always opposed to this profession, one day, her uncle (El-Hadj Mamadi CONDE) who resided in Kouroussa center visited the village where he found Lanciné spirited play flute, he hit him hard; Ie circumcising was in that village also called Amadi DIARRA, the latter came to tell his father that: (willingly or Lanciné strength always accompany me with his flute in my circumcision missions), and thanks that circumcising Lanciné that could follow this profession.

Every evening at the age of 17, he went with his flock in a clay savanna named (Fatuma-Fafara) or there is a pond, it is in this pool he was watering his oxen, he took advantage of this opportunity to sit under a tree in this place to repeat, this cheese is called Malinke language (tabadjou). He also was going to the fields to cultivate.

In 1992 he lost his mother (Djéssou KANDE), after the funeral, a few years later, he went to work in Siguiri gold mining with his family from there, he went Conakry or his family found him later, he was recruited in the ballet Joan MACAULET in 2001.
