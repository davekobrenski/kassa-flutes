						<td>\( L_{eff} \)</td>
						<td>The <strong>effective tube length</strong> associated with each desired note. This is the length the flute would be <em>theoretically</em> if it were &ldquo;uncomplicated by end corrections, toneholes, and the like&rdquo; (Hopkin, p.18). For flutes that are open at both ends (the blowhole constitutes an open end), this length is equal to the ½ the actual wavelength of the note itself.</td>

					<tr>
						<td>\( A \)</td>
						<td>The <strong>actual tube length</strong> of the desired lowest note of the flute. We use the <em>effective</em> tube length \( L_{eff} \), above, to <em>estimate</em> the actual length — but we won&rsquo;t know the <em>actual</em> length of the flute until we have reduced the flute&rsquo;s length down until it produces the correct note. We need the actual length of <em>just the lowest note</em>, however, in order to accurately position the rest of our toneholes using the <em>tonehole correction factor</em>, that we will calculate below.</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>\( C \)</td>
						<td>The <strong>tonehole correction factor</strong> — this is really the crux of the matter and what we are after; it is the amount the hole position must be displaced from the effective tube length (above), given the variables that follow:</td>

					<tr>
						<td>\( d_t \)</td>

					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>\( t_e \)</td>
						<td>the <strong><em>effective</em> thickness of the tonehole</strong> (this is the flute&rsquo;s wall thickness <em>plus</em> some end corrections that depend on the diameter of the hole). \( t_e\ =\ t\ +\ .75d_h \)</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>\( s \)</td>
						<td>the distance between \( L_{eff} \) for the hole in question and \( L_{eff} \) for the next hole below (or the entire tube in the case of the first open hole)</td>
