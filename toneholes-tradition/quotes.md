During their migration from Africa into Europe as early as 40,000 years ago, our ancestors were already making music.

The essence of the flute is as fundamental as wind moving through reeds, but its unique power comes from the fact that what gives it voice is the living breath of the player, invoking it to resonate with sound.

The diameter and length of the tube, the size and shape of the mouthpiece, and even the size of the toneholes in relation to their placement along the tube are just a few important factors to consider when building even the most basic of flutes. In short, constructing a playable flute is no simple business.

In many ways, this is the enigma of our past: science can only tell us so much about the moment in time represented by an artifact; the rest is left to our imagination.

Having honed their skills with a lifetime of musical immersion, they fine-tune the pitch of their instruments by ear until the flute can sing back to them the very songs they grew up with.

That the living breath of the player awakens elements of wood and earth to resonate into sacred song gives the flutes a place in the realm of the mystical â€” both for those who play it, and for those who are transported by its sounds.

If we can accept that all people share the same genetic lineage, then we must also accept that we share the same capacity for intellectual thought, creativity, and innovation. How a people expresses that potential is simply a matter of choice. What results from those choices is culture.
